# drum-kit-project-web-development
🥁 Drum Kit Web App
This is a fun and interactive Drum Kit project I built as part of my Web Development Course on Udemy. The goal of this project was to practice essential front-end development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen several important web development concepts, including:

✅ HTML for structuring the page

✅ CSS for styling and animations

✅ JavaScript to add interactivity

✅ Working with the Document Object Model (DOM)

✅ Using Event Listeners and handling keyboard and mouse events

✅ Understanding and using JavaScript Objects

✅ Writing Switch Statements for control flow

✅ Introduction to Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

🎮 How It Works
When you press a key or click a button, a sound plays and the button animates for a better user experience.
